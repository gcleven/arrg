# Guiding Research Question

> Do people with more primitive defense mechanisms spend more time on
> the internet arguing with people?

## Literature Review

-   Robert Plutchik et al., theorized that specific defenses are
    designed to manage specific emotions.
    -   Eight defenses \<\--\> eight emotions
    -   Defenses indicate polarity and similarity 
    -   Diagnostic personality types may derive from particular
        defensive styles
    -   Individuals use utilize any combination of defense mechanisms
-   Ego defenses are unconscious processes that manage emotional life
    and internal conflicts. Often moderated by stress. 
-   Recent literature has explored defense mechanisms in social media
    and in the spread of conspiracy theories during the COVID-19
    pandemic. 
    -   The later found negative co-occurrence between COVID-19 and
        youth as well as lower education level. 
    -   Mature defense styles negatively co-occurred and immature
        defense styles positively correlated with both general and
        COVID-19-related conspiracy theories.

## Variables

IVs: Defense Mechanisms (Categorization into "primitive" or "mature"
defense styles based on Life Style Index.), Content Exposure (Exposure
to "provocative" and "neutral" social media content.); DV: Engagement
(Outcome measure of simulated online engagement based on Likert
responses to possible actions). *The focal hypothesis positively
suggests that individuals with higher levels of primitive defense
mechanisms ("primitive group") are more likely (increase in) to engage
in arguments with people on the internet.* 

### Defense Mechanisms

-   LSI developed by Plutchik et al. (1979) to assess ego defense
    mechanisms under the assumption that their use pertains to specific
    affective states. 
    -   Modified self-report questionnaire (97-item ---\> 16-item) by
        selecting the most salient predictors of proposed ego defenses. 
    -   For each item, respondents are asked to indicate whether or not
        it describes them by selecting each item with "Usually true" (1)
        or "Usually not true" (2)
-   Categorization into "primitive" or "mature" defense styles based on
    Life Style Index (LSI)
    -   Participants are grouped into two categories ("primitive" or
        "mature") based on their ego defense level as determined by
        self-reported responses to a modified version of the Life Style
        Index (LSI).
    -   Defenses are theorized to be ranked in a hierarchy from
        primitive to mature: denial; regression; projection;
        displacement; repression; reaction formation;
        intellectualization; and compensation.
        -   Primitive Defenses: denial; regression; projection;
            displacement
        -   Mature Defenses: repression; reaction formation;
            intellectualization; compensation
-   Data recoded to sum scores and assign each individual to "primitive"
    or "mature" 

### Content Exposure

-   Content is shown to the participants that is either "provocative" or
    "neutral"
-   Each participants is shown 18 items (9 neutral; 9 provocative) and
    order is randomized. 
    -   Within-Subjects Design
-   Participants told that posts were all real (technically they were
    mostly real, but technically included debrief later)
-   Neutral posts were designed to be extremely non-opinionated,
    mundane, and non-controversial.
-   Provocative posts were designed to be highly polarizing, emotional,
    and likely to induce a reaction of some kind. 

### Engagement

-   Experiment is a Qualtrics survey to expose participants to simulated
    online scenarios. Participants were exposed to actual posts that
    were made (slightly adapted) and topics were relevant/controversial
    for all potential ideologies (questions were phrased in such a way
    to prevent polizaration of answers). 
    -   The relevant question here is participant choice to engage (or
        not) with the content (degree of engagement) and the nature of
        how they choose to engage (e.g., writing short comments, long
        comments, liking, reposting, sharing, etc) (nature of
        engagement). 
-   As participants view each post, they are asked to provide
    self-reported 5-point Likert scale ratings of how likely they are to
    do a variety of actions with the post. 
    -   The scale is from Extremely unlikely (1), Somewhat unlikely
        (2),  Neither likely nor unlikely (3), Somewhat likely (4), and
        Extremely likely (5). 
-   Noted here from least to most engagement, actions include:
    Completely ignore, Like (heart), Bookmark (or screenshot), Write a
    brief comment (either agree or disagree), Follow account, Respond to
    others in comments (either agree or disagree), Write an in-depth
    comment (either agree or disagree), Repost (share), Report
    post/account
    -   Hierarchical Response rating (least to most engagement)
    -   Completely ignore: No engagement at all.
    -   Like (heart): Minimal engagement, shows approval or
        acknowledgment without any effort.
    -   Bookmark (or screenshot): A bit more engagement as it indicates
        the user finds the content significant enough to save for later.
    -   Write a brief comment (either agree or disagree): More
        engagement than a like, as it involves crafting a response.
    -   Follow account: Indicates a commitment to see more content from
        the account, a higher level of engagement.
    -   Respond to others in comments (either agree or disagree):
        Indicates active participation in the discussion, which requires
        more time and thought.
    -   Write an in-depth comment (either agree or disagree): This shows
        a high level of engagement, as it involves thoughtful and
        time-consuming input.
    -   Repost (share): Indicates endorsement and willingness to share
        the content with one's own followers, implying a higher level of
        engagement.
    -   Report post/account: While negative, it's a significant form of
        engagement as it involves taking steps to flag content for
        review, showing a strong reaction to the content.

### Mediating Variable: Psychological Stress Level

-   From an evolutionary standpoint, defense mechanisms generally are
    responses to internal perceived threat and distress. They are
    compensatory measures. 
    -   Potentially, primitive defense mechanisms heighten threat
        perception in provocative scenarios, as this perceived threat
        motivates a more active engagement as a defense response 
-   Measured via self-report anxiety measure and optional heart rate
    measurements. 
    -   Participants asked to please rate their current level of anxiety
        pre and post experiment on a scale from not anxious at all to
        extremely anxious (5-point likert)
-   Note: excluded from subsequent analysis as data may have been flawed
    in collection (issue with scale)

## Composite Engagement

```{r composite-engagement}
